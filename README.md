Important as of version 9.1.2b: Log folder name changed to "Logs" instead of GcloudLogs, if you still want to use the old naming system you're free to change it in the Conf file.

Update! Version 9.4b now you can use a Cygwin installation to run the gsutil commands increasing perfomance and upload speed (steps to do this in the config file)
